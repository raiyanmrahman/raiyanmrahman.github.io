<p>Here are my most favorite websites. It was hard to rank useful, interesting, and fun websites in the same list, but I think I pulled through in the end. They're loosely ordered from least to most favorite.</p>

<p><em>10. <a href="https://trello.com/" title="Trello" target="_blank">Trello</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Boosting productivity is the name of the game for this website, which mainly serves to host digital kanbans. Kanbans are systems for tracking the progress done on tasks and optimizing that process which were developed at Toyota in the 1940s and they work great for personal use by students.</p>

<p><em>9. <a href="https://wikispeedrun.org/" title="Wikipedia Speedrun" target="_blank">Wikipedia Speedrun</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Reading Wikipedia normally is only the beginning. Turn the most popular online encyclopedia into an entertaining competion for who can get from one seemingly random article to another the fastest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>8. <a href="https://neal.fun/" title="neal.fun" target="_blank">neal.fun</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are a lot of ways to spend time on the internet, but one of the more charming ways is neal.fun. The pet project of Neal Agarwal, the website features an assortment of short experiences such as &quot;Internet Artifacts,&quot; where you can browse the history of the internet by year, and &quot;Ambient Chaos,&quot; where you can create a custom soundscape you can listen to in the background.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>7. <a href="https://www.geocaching.com/play" title="Geocaching" target="_blank">Geocaching</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Going outside may seem like the last thing you would do on the internet, but  this website and its game will prove you otherwise. Geocaching is similar to a treasure hunt: people hide things around the world for others to find, with an approximate location on the website being the only guidance. Who knows what awaits you there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>6. <a href="https://archipelago.gg/" title="Archipelago" target="_blank">Archipelago</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>This website is the answer to when  the video games you enjoy get stale. Archipelago generates random objectives for you to complete in-game that are incorporated with a multiplayer system where you must cooperate with players of entirely different games to get the items you need to advance towards victory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>5. <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/" title="Privacy Guides" target="_blank">Privacy Guides</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>With the prevalence of companies spying on unwitting consumers in the digital age, it is becoming more and more important to be proactive about maintaining our right to privacy. This website is a great resource for learning about how to do just that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>4. <a href="https://www.thepunctuationguide.com/index.html" title="The Punctuation Guide" target="_blank">The Punctuation Guide</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Ever wondered what an &quot;em dash&quot; is? Confused on whether to use a semicolon or comma? English grammar isn't taught beyond the basics in the Anglophone world despite its complexity, and I have found this website to be the most convenient way to learn and review it.</p>

<p><em>3. <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/" title="CyberChef" target="_blank">CyberChef</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Into cryptography, programming, or just want to edit an image? This project by the British intelligence, security and cyber agency has your back with its impressive array of  tools ready for your <span style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, serif">&quot;<span style="font-family: Consolas, 'Andale Mono', 'Lucida Console', 'Lucida Sans Typewriter', Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace">elite h4x0r</span>&quot;</span> needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>2. <a href="https://theoldnet.com/" title="The Old Net" target="_blank">The Old Net</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Be it nostalgia or curiosity, the Old Net welcomes anyone to time travel back to the wild west days of the internet, dotted with websites carved out by eclectic individuals and housing the beginnings of giants like Google and Apple. It even supports period-correct hardware (think old beige tower running Windows 95) for those who want the most authentic experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>1. <a href="https://tvtropes.org/" title="TV Tropes" target="_blank">TV Tropes</a></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Patterns (literary devices, tropes, whatever you want to call them) exist throughout media, and TV Tropes aims to break down those patterns to an almost excruciating degree. Although you may not see your favorite media the same ever again after visiting, this website will make you appreciate what goes on behind the scenes, in the minds of the writers that make them possible.</p>
