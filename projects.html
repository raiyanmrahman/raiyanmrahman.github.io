	    </p>
	    <p>It didn't take long after that to get our first of many assignments. These were our <a href="http://www.nystromco.com/ET-710/biography.asp?id=469" title="My Biography" target="_blank">biographies</a> (to be hosted on the professor's website), <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fZ8r8ZT9Ul1Kz3WdljKL0B47NuSimslAq5O6S7BRAdI/edit?usp=sharing" title="About Me" target="_blank">Google Slides presentations</a>  about ourselves; a faux <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rLeRLE1NeUMllOzOvKBdoLJeIBj_ZS7OCMgW1xYeYe8/edit?usp=sharing" title="Email to a Friend" target="_blank">email to a friend</a> about our the college experience so far; and finally <a href="Week 01/A1 My First Web Page.html" title="My First Webpage" target="_blank">our first webpage</a>, which was manually copied from a template. </p>
	    <p>As I was to soon discover first-hand, this was a <strong>writing-intensive </strong>class.</p></td>

		<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p><strong>Dreamweaver</strong> put an end to our day of writing HTML by hand, and was the focal point of this week. <a href="Week 02/Messing around with Dreamweaver.html" title="Messing around with Dreamweaver" target="_blank">A test page</a> let us both get familiar with the program and let the professor gauge our skills.
	    </p>
	    <p> A personal website was now in our sights, and some inspiration was needed, so our professor let us get some indirectly through our next assignment: a list of our <a href="Week 02/A5 Top 10 Websites.html" title="My Top 10 Websites!">Top 10 websites</a>. Then, we directly brainstormed some <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ES5oOQBJv8NHQ3VxDGG-6AKm2NpVEGwr8xeqTvwxra8/edit?usp=sharing" title="Quickwrite #1" target="_blank">ideas for our websites</a> and created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UpoZNim1Y5C8nLzRqqXgqnv4TZLKaD2d98sjQ_5Fp-0/edit?usp=sharing" title="News Summary" target="_blank">news article</a> summarizing the last 2 weeks (which was a precursor to this page!).</p></td>

	<tr style="border: 1px solid">
		<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="width: 150px">03</td>
		<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p>We started this week by exploring the evolution of communication, from going up and down chains of command in the past to the free flow of information today, which was possible thanks to this week's focus: <strong>Hyperlinks</strong>.</p>
		  <p>This week also marked the official start of this projects page, which Professor Nystrom demonstrated with  Gabriel's website, a former student who made such a detailed website that the professor uses it when he forgets something.</p>
		  <p>Again, we created <a href="Week 03/Messing around with Hyperlinks.html" title="Messing around with Hyperlinks">a test page</a> to try out hyperlinks by linking them to local files and outside websites; with titles when hovered over and the ability to create new tabs. </p>
	  <p>With  our newfound knowledge, the professor announced our websites would be soon hosted on his domain, so he made us go to our website and add the finishing touches by adding hyperlinks to our website wherever necessary to link it all up.</p></td>
	</tr>
	<tr style="border: 1px solid">
		<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF" style="width: 150px">04</td>
		<td bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p>The moment had finally come, and it finally was time to upload our files to the professor's remote server. <strong>Paths</strong> were paramount to this deployment being successful, so they were the focus of this week.</p>
	    <p>Filezilla was introduced to us, which is an open-source program for connecting to the&nbsp; professor's remote server for FTP actions. Through this program, we  uploaded (and later updated) <a href="http://www.nystromco.com/rrahman/" title="Homepage">our brand new website</a>.</p>
	    <p>P.S. I did take it upon myself during the weekend to host <a href="https://raiyanmrahman.github.io/" title="Homepage (GitHub)" target="_blank">my website on GitHub Pages</a> as I wanted somewhere to test things and I was getting impatient, so there's that too.</p></td>
